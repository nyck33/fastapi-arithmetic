### 2. Build a RESTFUL API server and upload the source to GitHub

Use a free service to build a RESTFUL API server.
Example: AWS + DRF + Postgresql

Provide the URL of FastAPI or Swagger UI to check if the CRUD function is working properly.

Configure an API service that can perform arithmetic operations through parameters on the server and document how to use it in FastAPI or Swagger UI.

Upload the developed source to GitHub and provide the URL.

To ensure accurate communication, we used the DeepL translator.

Please understand that we want to check your basic development skills and communication skills.

If you have any questions, please let us know.
